# Arxiv-Articles-Text-Mining

This project sets out to pull data from website - arxiv.org which is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for 1,874,299 scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

Project Steps:

----> 

Performed web scraping of arxiv scholarly articles and develop a scraper to replicate their data using Python libraries (Beautiful Soup, Pandas) and selenium script.
       
----> 

Constructed a keyword based search engine using vector space model (NLP algorithm) for detecting articles related to natural language processing and rank them based on            their similarity to the query.

---->

Refined the text search engine using information retrieval technique: Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) by transforming word document frequencies for            further text similarity and analysis with Scikit-Learn and NLP Libraries.
